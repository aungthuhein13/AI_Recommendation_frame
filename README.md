# AI Frame Recommender + Visualizer App

This project is an AI-powered frame recommendation and visualization tool built with Python and Streamlit. Users can upload an image of an artwork and receive smart frame style recommendations from an inventory. The selected frame is automatically applied around the painting in a realistic preview.

---

## Features

- Upload artwork image and input dimensions (in inches)
- Recommend a frame style based on AI embeddings
- Realistically preview the artwork inside the selected frame
- Visualized with PIL (Python Imaging Library) and Streamlit
- Modular pipeline: frame generation, metadata embedding, UI preview

## Workflow

### 1. Generate Frame Images
Use placeholder image to visualize frame inventory using `PIL`.

```bash
python crt_images.py
```

Output:
- data/frame_inventory_with_images.csv
- data/images/ (contains generated frame PNGs)
